## How to use

### Web

#### AngularFire (AngularJS)

> AngularFire is the officially supported AngularJS binding for Firebase. Firebase is a full backend so you don't need servers to build your Angular app!

#### EmberFire (Ember)

> EmberFire is the officially supported adapter for using Firebase with Ember Data. The DS.FirebaseAdapter provides all of the standard DS.Adapter methods and will automatically synchronize the store with a Firebase database.

#### BackboneFire (Backbone.js)

> BackboneFire is the officially supported Backbone binding for Firebase. The bindings let you use special model and collection types that will automatically synchronize with Firebase, and also allow you to use regular Backbone.Sync based synchronization methods.

#### ReactFire (ReactJS)

> ReactJS is a framework for building large, complex user interfaces. Firebase complements it perfectly by providing an easy-to-use, realtime data source for populating the state of React components. With ReactFire, it only takes a few lines of JavaScript to integrate Firebase into React apps via the ReactFireMixin.

#### Ionic

> Ionic is a front-end SDK for developing hybrid mobile apps with HTML5. Because Ionic uses Angular, developers can use AngularFire to easily wire up a Firebase backend with an Ionic app.
